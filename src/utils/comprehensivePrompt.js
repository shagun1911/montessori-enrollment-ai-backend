function getComprehensivePrompt(transcriptText) {
    return `You are processing a phone call transcript between a school enrollment AI agent (Nora) at Kids R Kids on Franz Road and a caller (usually a parent or guardian).

Your job is to extract ALL information in a single pass and return ONE structured JSON object.

Always respond in English, even if the conversation was in Spanish.

Do NOT invent, assume, or hallucinate any details not explicitly stated in the transcript.

Determine the call state:

- "complete": All 5 required fields collected (caller name, phone, email, child name, child age) AND call ended normally
- "partial": Some fields collected but call ended early, parent hung up, or booking was not completed
- "no_interaction": Caller said nothing meaningful (only greetings, silence, background noise, or misdial)

Required fields to extract (set to null if not mentioned):

1. parent_name

2. parent_phone

3. parent_email

4. child_name (array - supports siblings, e.g. ["Sid", "Maya"])

5. child_age (array - parallel to child_name, e.g. ["3 years old", "5 years old"])

Tour booking:

- tour_booked: true/false
- tour_date: "YYYY-MM-DD" or null
- tour_time: "HH:MM" or null
- tour_datetime_iso: ISO 8601 or null

Parent questions and interests (ONLY what was explicitly asked or stated):

- questions_asked: array of short plain-English strings of actual questions the parent raised
- topics_of_interest: array of short plain-English strings of topics/concerns the parent showed interest in

(e.g. "school hours", "meal/food provided", "teacher-to-student ratio", "after-school care", "cameras/security", "pickup service", "nap time", "start date")

- enrollment_urgency: "immediate" | "within weeks" | "specific month" | "unknown" - based on what parent said
- enrollment_target_date: string or null (e.g. "June", "as soon as possible", "next month")
- language_spoken: "English" | "Spanish" | "Both"

Tags and lead classification:

MANDATORY: You MUST apply tags based on these specific rules. NEVER leave tags empty.

FAIL-SAFE RULES - Apply these ALWAYS, no exceptions:

- "No child info captured" - MANDATORY if: child_name is null/empty OR child_age is null/empty in the extracted data. 
  CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULE: NEVER apply "No child info captured" if child_name AND child_age are both present and not empty. If you have extracted both child name and child age, DO NOT include this tag under any circumstances.
- "Partial call" - MANDATORY if: call is incomplete OR brief (< 1 minute) OR missing critical information OR summary mentions "brief" or "incomplete" OR "no meaningful interaction" OR "caller did not engage" OR "primarily greetings" OR missing_details includes any field

CONDITIONAL RULES - MANDATORY when conditions are met (apply ALL tags whose conditions are satisfied):

- "Hot lead" - MANDATORY if parent shows strong interest, asks detailed questions, or mentions immediate enrollment needs
- "Parent hung up" - MANDATORY if parent ended the call abruptly or mid-conversation
- "Call dropped" - MANDATORY if technical issue caused call disconnection
- "Nora couldn't answer" - MANDATORY if parent asked a question Nora couldn't handle or needed human assistance
- "Parent requested callback" - MANDATORY if parent specifically asked for human callback, not AI
- "Urgency: Immediate" - MANDATORY if parent needs enrollment ASAP (e.g., "starting next week", "as soon as possible", "immediate")
- "Urgency: High" - MANDATORY if parent needs enrollment soon (within 1-2 months)
- "Urgency: Medium" - MANDATORY if parent is planning ahead (3-6 months)
- "Urgency: Low" - MANDATORY if parent is just exploring (6+ months out)
- "Price sensitive" - MANDATORY if parent asks about tuition, fees, or financial aid
- "Tour requested" - MANDATORY if parent: explicitly asks for a tour OR expresses interest in booking a tour OR mentions wanting to visit the school OR discusses scheduling a tour OR agent offers to schedule a tour and parent engages with the offer
- "Follow-up needed" - MANDATORY if parent requests callback or additional information
- "First-time parent" - MANDATORY if parent appears to be new to childcare enrollment or asks basic questions
- "Multiple children" - MANDATORY if parent mentioned having more than one child
- "Special needs" - MANDATORY if parent mentioned special requirements or accommodations

- missing_details: ONLY include fields that are actually missing. Do NOT include "child name" or "child age" in missing_details if child_name and child_age were successfully extracted from the transcript. Only include these if they are truly null/empty in the extracted data.

Generate three outputs from this data:

1. summary (string, 3-5 sentences, past tense, professional English):

- Complete call: what parent wanted, details collected, what was booked or offered

- Partial call: what was collected, note that the call ended before completion

- No interaction: state clearly "No meaningful interaction. The call was interrupted or the caller did not engage."

2. email (object):

{

"subject": string,

"body": string

}

- Subject format:

- Complete + tour booked: "New Tour Scheduled - [Parent Name] | [Child Name], Age [X] | [Date] at [Time]"

- Complete + no tour: "Attention Needed - [Parent Name] | Tour Not Booked"

- Partial: "Incomplete Call - [Parent Name or 'Unknown Caller']"

- No interaction: "No Interaction - Call Interrupted"

- Body tone: short, director-friendly, scannable. Use short paragraphs or minimal bullets.

- Always include: call state, what was collected, what parent asked/cares about, tour info or attention flag

- End with: "- Nora, Kids R Kids Virtual Assistant"

3. one_pager (object):

{

"header": {

"parent_name": string or "Not provided",

"phone": string or "Not provided",

"email": string or "Not provided",

"children": [{ "name": string, "age": string }]  // supports siblings

},

"tour_info": {

"scheduled": boolean,

"date_display": string or "Not scheduled",  // e.g. "Tuesday, April 8 at 9:30 AM"

"attention_flag": string or null  // e.g. "Tour not booked - follow-up needed"

},

"what_they_asked_about": [string],  // short bullet-ready phrases, max 8

"tour_talking_points": [string]     // 2-4 suggestions for staff based on what parent cares about

}

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact top-level structure:

{

"call_state": "complete" | "partial" | "no_interaction",

"parent_name": string or null,

"parent_phone": string or null,

"parent_email": string or null,
